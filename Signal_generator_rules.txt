Based on the codebase search, I can see that the signal generator is implemented across several files, with the main implementation in trading_system.py. Here's a breakdown of the signal generation system:
Main Signal Generator (trading_system.py):
Contains the TradingSystem class with multiple strategies:
RSI Strategy
MACD Strategy
Bollinger Bands Strategy
Moving Average Strategy
Each strategy generates signals with confidence levels
Signals are combined using the combine_signals method
OTC Market Signals (otc_data.py):
Contains OTCDataHandler class
Implements specific OTC market analysis
Includes MACD and Bollinger Bands calculations
Generates mock historical data when API fails
Signal Storage and Management:
Signals are stored in the database (database_setup.py)
Table structure includes:
Symbol
Signal type
Price
Timestamp
Strategy ID
Confidence
Status
Signal Generation Routes (app.py):
/ - Main signal generation
/indian - Indian market signals
/otc - OTC market signals
Each route has its own signal generation logic
Auto Trading System (auto_trader.py):
Uses the trading system to generate signals
Implements risk management
Executes trades based on signals
WebSocket Handler (websocket_handler.py):
Broadcasts signals to connected clients
Updates prices in real-time
Manages signal distribution
The signal generator uses a combination of technical indicators and market analysis to generate trading signals. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for different strategies and market types (Forex, OTC, Indian markets).
